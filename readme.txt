== Description ==

**Manage Bibliographic Citations**

Academic Press supports Apa, Chicago, Harvard, MLA, Turabian citation styles to automatically format your references. When doing inline citations,
either use automatic formatting or contextual formatting so that your citation perfectly fits into your sentence. A simple shortcode is perfectly
fine to display the table of bibliography below your posts.


**Import/Export Popular Bibliographic Formats**

Use BibTex, Endnote, Medline, RIS or other popular formats to display citations on your posts. 
Use the powerful scripting engine to import data from these formats, working with these data sets (search, sort, extract, merge) using 
collections, and finally to export data from a collection to other formats.


**Footnotes**

Dynamically hide additional content to improve the flow of your articles. Custom numbering formats include numeric, alphabetic (lower and upper case), 
roman (lower and upper case), and greek (lower and upper case). Table of footnotes is automatically displayed at the end of each post, supporting
several options.


**Fast and Lightweight Plugin**

Academic Press has been designed to be lightweight (use of a clean modern programming convention).
It does not create additional database tables: all data are stored in WordPress posts by using shortcodes, or in external resources (optional).
This plugin comes with a "VirtualBox" to test your shortcodes on the fly while writing articles, thus you can easily check correct citations. 
You can use this VirtualBox to easily convert between BibTex, Endnote or other formats.


**Supports Internationalization**

* English
* German


**Future Features**
A data stream to bibliographic servers to more easily search for references, or to store the results (i.e. collections) on 
external resources (e.g. bibliographic servers). And much more languages. And custom citation styles.
